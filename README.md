# Lock Login Reborn
LockLogin by RD, also compatible with bungee and velocity, is by far, one of the most secure and optimized auth plugins for your minecraft server or network, with one of the best support by its developer ( acording to the reviews ).


Stop using plugins such as AuthMe, which have proved to be less secure and easy to exploit. LockLogin is constantly under security and stability tests, to ensure the users receive the best experience.


Some of the most notable features are:

Password
2FA
Pin
User lookup
Alt accounts finder
Accounts per IP limit
Illegal name checker ( uses mojang's regex; letters from aA-zZ, numbers 0-9 and _ )
Similar name checker
IP health check ( checks for non-null IP and if the IP is proxy )
Each user, it's own configuration ( each user can choose if he has 2fa and pin and persistent sessions )
2 bot security layers
Pre-connection security layer ( checks if user pings the server and the IP is valid )
Post-connection security layer ( captcha and proxy check )
BungeeHack protection ( install LockLogin in all your servers )
Plugin message channel protected against attacks ( LockLogin comunicates through a password protected channel )
Brute force attack protection
Smart already playing protection
And more, using LockLogin modules ( official or community )


If you are interested in creating a module, take a look at the API wiki


Please note LockLogin modules won't be loaded if you put them in plugins folder, LockLogin modules must be loaded by LockLogin, in: ServerFolder/plugins/LockLogin/plugin/modules


Always make sure you are using the latest LockLogin version when installing a module, otherwise support won't be given
